### **Some Facts About Me**

- I always had an interest about computers because they felt like magic to me. I started programming in 2016 in BILSEM (Beşiktaş Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi). Since then, my passion for computers increased tremendously.

- I use Arch Linux as my daily OS but I've also tried some other Linux Distrubitons in Virtual Machines (like Fedora, Gentoo, Void etc). I love customizing and adding small and fun scripts to my OS.

- I am also interested in math especially calculus and linear algebra. I try my best to work on them as a hobby.
