### **Some Facts About Me**

- I always had an interest about computers because they were like magic to me. I started programming in 2016 in BILSEM (Beşiktaş Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi). Since then, my passion for computers increased tremendously.

- I love Linux! I use Arch Linux with KDE daily but I've also tried some other Linux distrubitons in Virtual Machines (like Fedora, Gentoo, Void etc). I love customizing my OS.

- I am also interested in math especially calculus and linear algebra. I try my best to work on them as a hobby.
